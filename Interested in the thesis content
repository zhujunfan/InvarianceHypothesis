Hi Peichocki,
I'm Junfan. It's really interesting topic for invariance hypothesis, and thank you for your commits and sharing here! 
By the way, I'm really interested in what you've mentioned, your thesis "Market Microstructure Invariance: An empirical analysis of European stocks".
In fact, I'm learning market microstructure theories recently, and your works inspire me a lot. I'd appreciate if you permit to share a link or pdf to me, and my email is junfanzhu@outlook.com  Hope we can communicate more about this topic.
Sincerely,
Junfan
